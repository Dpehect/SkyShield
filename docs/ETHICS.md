# Ethics & Legal Guidance (Mandatory read)

- This project is *passive detection only*; active interference (de-auth, jamming) is strictly out of scope.
- Before using any RF sniffing or camera monitoring, obtain explicit authorization for the monitored airspace and comply with local laws.
- For public spaces, consult local privacy laws; redaction and anonymization of traces are recommended.
- Keep logs for audits and implement access control for the UI and recorded data.
- If uncertain, consult a qualified legal advisor before deploying.
